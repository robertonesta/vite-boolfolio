    <p class="silver_color py-1">
      Hi folks, I'm <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">Roberto</span>, 30yo guy from Puglia, Italy. Before
      becoming a <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">Full Stack Web Dev</span> I studied Foreign Languages in
      Bari. This department has given me a full open-mindnessess about the World, both my own culture and especially
      those of others.
    </p>
    <p class="silver_color py-1">My journey in the world of <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">programming</span>
      started in the mid December 2022, when I decided to
      undertake the <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">Boolean Careers</span> training course, learning the
      basics of 360-degree programming both on the <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">Front End</span> and on
      the <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">Back End</span>. So I started <span
        class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">700 hours</span> of live online course to become Full Stack Web Developer,
      learning: <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold"></span>, HTML<span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">CSS</span>,
      <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold"></span>Javascript,
      <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">Vue</span>, <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">PHP</span>, <span
        class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">Laravel</span>. The course required a full-time commitment and as in a real
      school, a 24/7 participation in all activities is required.
    </p>
    <p class="silver_color">
      So without further ado, take a look at my <span class="text_accent_custom fw-bold">Portfolio</span>, so you can
      see my fave personal projects and the codes as well. Hope you like'em!
